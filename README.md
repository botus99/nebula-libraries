My libraries for the Nebula audio plugin.

### Description

---

Back in the early 2010's I was obsessed with the technology used by Acustica Audio's flagship plugin: Nebula. I made a few libraries (with varying levels of success) of guitar cabinet and tube preamp using their proprietary NAT software. I have not used these programs in years, as I have been moving away from using Nebula in general.

Originally, these were posted for free on Acustica's forum. Acustica have since removed their forum altogether, so here is where I have decided to host the libraries for posterity.

Most vectors will need to be extracted with 7zip. I had to split the files up to stay within Github's upload file size limit.
